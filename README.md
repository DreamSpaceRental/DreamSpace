# DreamSpace
A program for listing and finding Professional spaces to rent.

## Front-End:
  The front end will be created in React, using Redux in order to connect to the Back-End.  It will be built on a base of shared elements which then send requests to the Back-End API which will be seperate from the Front-End.

## Back-End:
  The Back End will be created in Ruby, which will host the API, calculate all necessary values and elements and send them to the Front-End as responses to API requests.  This will be hosted on AWS as an EC2 instance in a Docker Container.

## Database:
  The Database will be created as a MySQL database that will be hosted on AWS as an RDS cluster, which can easily be accessed from the Back-End.
